# Sports Person Classifier

## Overview

The Sports Person Classifier is a machine learning project designed to classify images of sports personalities. This project utilizes web scraping tools to gather a dataset, processes images to extract key features, and employs a trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classification.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Gather datasets from various online sources or use official datasets.
- **Image Processing**: Utilizes a wavelength transformer to extract essential features from input images.
- **Model Training**: Implements SVM for classification, using a pre-trained model saved as a pickle file.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows users to upload images for classification, with results displayed seamlessly.
